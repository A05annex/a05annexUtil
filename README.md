# a05annexUtil
Utility classes for use in First FTC/FRC robot code, but that are not dependent on either
First FTC or First FRC infrastructure. We built this library as we realized that there 
is a lot of common code (functionality) that we use both inside and outside the
robot-specific code - for example, in autonomous path planning. We wanted to package that code so that it could be
used regardless of the FTC/FRC base platform libraries and/or hardware.
